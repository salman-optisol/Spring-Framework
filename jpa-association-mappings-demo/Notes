What I learned in this project:
-------------------------------

Uni directional mappings - only one entity holds the reference to other
Bi directional mappings - Both entities have reference to each other (provides additional benefits)

Choosing from the above two, signifies how can we navigate from an entity.

Lets create example for all the types:
    @ManyToOne
    @OneToMany
    @ManyToMany
    @OneToOne
